          <p><strong>Last updated: 09-06-2025</strong></p>
          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>Thank you for choosing to play Threads of Time. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe experience while you enjoy our mobile game. This Privacy Policy outlines what data may be collected, how it may be used, and the steps we take to protect it.</p>
          <p>By playing Threads of Time, you agree to the practices described below.</p>
          <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
          <p>Threads of Time does not collect any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical location.</p>
          <p>However, to help improve the game and ensure a better user experience, the game may make use of third-party services that automatically collect anonymous, non-personal data, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Type, model, operating system, language, and screen resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> General gameplay metrics such as level progress, session length, and actions taken in-game.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Technical issues or performance data that help us improve stability and fix bugs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of this data is collected without identifying you personally.</p>
          <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
          <p>Any collected data is used strictly for technical and development purposes, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhancing performance and optimizing gameplay</li>
            <li>Identifying bugs or crashes and ensuring app stability</li>
            <li>Analyzing user behavior to improve user experience</li>
            <li>Testing compatibility with different devices and Android versions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not use this data for advertising, profiling, or any commercial purposes.<br />We do not sell, rent, or trade any data with third parties.</p>
          <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>To help us manage and improve the game, Threads of Time integrates third-party tools which may collect anonymous data. These services follow their own privacy policies. We currently use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> ‚Äì for game compatibility, performance monitoring, and achievements</li>
            <li><strong>Unity Analytics</strong> ‚Äì for anonymous gameplay tracking and crash reporting</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can learn more about their data policies here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity Privacy Policy</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>These services may collect information automatically through SDKs included in the game build.</p>
          <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>Anonymous usage data and crash reports, if collected, are retained only as long as necessary for debugging, analytics, or gameplay optimization purposes.</p>
          <p>After serving their intended use, this data is either deleted or further anonymized so it cannot be linked to any specific individual or device.</p>
          <h2>6. Security</h2>
          <p>We take technical and organizational measures to ensure that any collected data remains secure, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimizing the type and amount of data collected</li>
            <li>Using secure communication protocols</li>
            <li>Regularly updating third-party SDKs and Unity services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While we strive to protect data integrity, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We encourage players to also manage their privacy through their own device settings.</p>
